# Ruby takehome assignment

Build an API for a chatbot using Rails 8+.

Please note the time you have spent on this assignment in your solution.

The goal is to have a technical conversation about your solution with one of your potential future colleagues, so please show as much or as little of your technical depth and breadth as you feel is relevant.

Please make your solution available to us at least the day before the technical interview so we have a reasonable chance to read through it and prepare; this includes instructions on where and how to access and run the application.

Requirements:

 * All data must be persisted in the database.
 * A chat session must only be available to the user who initialized it. However, the application as a whole must be able to handle multiple users.
 * It doesn't matter what the chatbot responds with (you don't need your own AI API keys.)
