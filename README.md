# Ruby takehome assignment

Build a chatbot using Rails 8+, Stimulus, and Hotwired.

Please note the time you have spent on this assignment in your solution.

The goal is to have a technical conversation about your solution with one of your potential future colleagues, so please show as much or as little of your technical depth and breadth as you feel is relevant.

Requirements:

 * All data must be persisted in the database.
 * A chat session must only be available to the user who initialized it. However, the application as a whole must be able to handle multiple users.
 * It doesn't matter what the chatbot responds with (you don't need your own AI API keys.)
