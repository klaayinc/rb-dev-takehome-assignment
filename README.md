# Ruby takehome assignment

Build a chat-bot using Rails 8+, Stimulus, and Hotwired.

The goal here is to make a PR that introduces a chat-bot for the users to interact with.

Requirements:

 * All data must be persisted in the database.
 * A chat session must only be available to the user who initialized it. But the application as a whole must be able to handle multiple users.
 * It doesn't matter what the chat bot responds with (you don't need your own AI API keys.)
